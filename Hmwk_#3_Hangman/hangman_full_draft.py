'''
1. Let the player pick a word from the file attached to the letter (words.txt).
2. The program guesses based on the player's answers.
3. On the first move we show the number of letters in the word.
4. Application  analyzes the list available to it and offers the most likely letter (you can display the percentage of probability AND/OR the number of words from which to choose).
5. If the player agrees with the choice, then he/she writes out a word with letters in the correct positions.
6. If you do not agree, then the application gives the next option.â€¦ and so on.
 
7. When the word is guessed - print the word and the number of attempts.
